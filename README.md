# Pathfinder-Assignment 
This website works with just HTML and CSS. 
I did this at the beginning of my journey.
Looking back, I would utilize Bootstrap 5, CSS grid, and Flexbox. 
You'll notice this site is not responsive when changing frameworks, these are some things I would work on these as well as the hover effects among many other things.
